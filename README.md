- 👋 Hi, I’m @GregDoesStuff
- 👀 I’m interested in making the transition from Construction and Manufacturing (I know) to Cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics, studying for my Security+ first, and building on my knowledge base of IT/Networking experience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet...
- 📫 How to reach me? On Twitter @GregWilsonTahoe
